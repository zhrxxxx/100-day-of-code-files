**Today's Progress**: I make a blackjack game that player only able to select level and draw cards infinetly and calculate their score. <Br/>
Future Function: <Br/>
1.compete with program robort [difficulty: Hard] <Br/>

### Day 3: January 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Complete goal 6 (Ace can be 1 or 11 depend on player's total score), now the program can identify whether the card is a number card or a face card. Face cards are all count as 10 rather than 11/12/13.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 0: February 30, 2021 (Example)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
